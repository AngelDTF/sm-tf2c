# Sourcemod TF2C
Here is a repository that includes some of the modern solutions to Sourcemod issues in the Team Fortress 2 Classic mod.

# Warning
The Beta branch is still being actively developed and not all plugins may not be supported yet. If it exists, please switch over to the release branch for more stable compatibility.

# Installation
For easier use of Sourcemod on TF2Classic, download Sourcemod and Metamod from the official website, then replace the sourcemod files with the files in this repository.<br />
It is recommended that you do the above before modifying the core gamedata/config files of Sourcemod.
